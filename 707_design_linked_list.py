Design Linked List
Leetcode # 707

Design your implementation of the linked list. 
You can choose to use a singly or doubly linked list.
A node in a singly linked list should have 
two attributes: val and next. val is the value 
of the current node, and next is a pointer/reference 
to the next node.
If you want to use the doubly linked list, you will 
need one more attribute prev to indicate the previous 
node in the linked list. Assume all nodes in the 
linked list are 0-indexed.

class MyLinkedList:

    def __init__(self):

    def addAtHead(self, val: int) -> None:
        

    def addAtTail(self, val: int) -> None:
        

    def addAtIndex(self, index: int, val: int) -> None:
        

    def deleteAtIndex(self, index: int) -> None:
        


# Your MyLinkedList object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = MyLinkedList()
# param_1 = obj.get(index)
# obj.addAtHead(val)
# obj.addAtTail(val)
# obj.addAtIndex(index,val)
# obj.deleteAtIndex(index)
