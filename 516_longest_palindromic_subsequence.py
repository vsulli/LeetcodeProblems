Given a string s, find the longest palindromic 
subsequence's length in s.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be 
derived from another sequence by deleting 
some or no elements without changing the order 
of the remaining elements.

sol = Solution()

print(sol.longestPalindromeSubseq(s = "bbbab"))
