# Leetcode Problems
These are my submissions to leetcode, including initial attempts. After attempting each question I have found either an optimized solution online or a solution suggested by Neetcode to study and learn from. 

Rather than focusing on solving as many problems as possible, my goal is to understand all of the data structures and algorithms behind each problem and learn them by concept. This will enable me to apply what I learn to unseen problems in the future to solve them more efficiently.

## Big O Notation
3 Rules for Calculating It
- always calculate the worst-case scenario
- avoid including constant terms
- avoid lower values

## Two Pointers

given a sorted array you can reduce it down to O(n) instead of O(n^2)
ex) Two Sum
left and right pointers
if sum is too low, increment left pointer
if sum is too high, increment right pointer
if pointers meet then there is no solution

When to use:
* finding which numbers add up to a target
* finding items that sum to 0 in a given array
* finding max water between two walls
