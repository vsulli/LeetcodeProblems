Given a list of non-negative integers 
nums, arrange them such that they form 
the largest number and return it.

Since the result may be very large, 
so you need to return a string instead 
of an integer.

'''

from typing import List


class Solution:
    def largestNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> str:
        pass

sol = Solution()

print(sol.largestNumber(nums = [10,2]))

print(sol.largestNumber(nums = [3,30,34,5,9]))
